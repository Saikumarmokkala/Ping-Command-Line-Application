Hello Cloudflare people, 

I thought the project was quite fun, and I appreciate your apparent friendliness. I've included the file ping.c which does all the functionalities. These include various aspects of the project where it contains backend code to do the icmp, and socket stuff, the frontend CLI stuff. The project targets towards a relatively modern version of linux. I didn't take note of any specific kernel versions required to run the project, but I think it'll be fine.

I have used the programming language C. The project builds with gcc, other than that my code is relatively well documented, so hopefully you don't have any trouble reading it. I also thought that the project was quite fun. I even plan on extending it a little bit so that I can use it to monitor when my servers and computers go offline.

To the best of my understanding my application does the following: 

-[X] Has a CLI Interface 
-[X] Sends ICMP echo requests in an infinite loop. 
-[X] Reports packet loss and echo latency for each message. 
-[X] Supports IPV6.
-[X] Supports IPV4.
-[X] Supports custom TLL. 

Thank you, and stay healthy.
